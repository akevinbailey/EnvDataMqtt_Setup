# EnvDataMqtt_Setup
## PURPOSE
A PySide6/Qt desktop utility that discovers a BLE-enabled environmental sensor and securely pushes its initial setup (Wi-Fi, DHCP/static 
IP, HTTPS configuration server, MQTT host/port/credentials, and CA certificate) over a custom BLE service. Itâ€™s distributed under the MIT
License.

## DESCRIPTION
The app provides a clean, form-based UI built with Qt widgets for setting up the sensor to connect to the Wi-Fi network, HTTPS 
configuration server, and the MQTT broker. You can save the current form to JSON and reload it later, making it easy to version and 
reuse configurations. A Bluetooth device picker scans for Low Energy devices and highlights ones exposing the expected service, 
simplifying selection before connecting.

Once connected, the tool discovers the target service and its characteristics, then writes a compact JSON payload to the device and 
optionally enables notifications on the status characteristic for live feedback. Windows users also get proper taskbar/title-bar icons 
via an explicit AppUserModelID and resource-path handling, which is compatible with bundled executables.

## INSTRUCTIONS
To run the Python script, you'll need Python 3.10 or higher and install (pip) the PySide6 package.  To create the executable, you'll need
to install (pip) PyInstaller 6.10 or higher and run the `build-*-exe.bat` script.
